# PongGameFGPA

## Overview

PongGameFGPA is an implementation of the classic Pong game on an FPGA using SystemVerilog. Players can control the paddle's movement using buttons on the FPGA board to play the game.

## Features

- **FPGA-Based Gameplay**: Utilizes FPGA hardware to run the Pong game.
- **SystemVerilog Implementation**: The game logic is written in SystemVerilog.
- **Button Controls**: Players can move the paddle up and down using the FPGA's onboard buttons.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An FPGA development board compatible with the provided code.
- A development environment set up for SystemVerilog.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NooryA/PongGameFGPA.git
   ```
2. Open the project files in your FPGA development environment.
3. Synthesize and upload the code to your FPGA board.

## Usage

- Use the designated buttons on the FPGA to move the paddle up and down.
- The game starts automatically upon uploading the code to the FPGA.
